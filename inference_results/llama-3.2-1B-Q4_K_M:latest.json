A. The number of employees who can be managed is determined by a simple formula: (number of employees * cost per employee) / unit price = budgeted labor hours required to produce one unit. In the example above, if $2.50 per hour for production workers is budgeted and the target selling price is set at $150 per unit, the maximum number of units that can be produced by this company's resources is 500 (number of employees * cost per employee) / unit price = ($15,000 * .50) / ($150), or about 300. If production workers were to work on weekends and the budgeted labor hours for a weekend was doubled, then 600 units could be produced with the same number of people.\n        B. It would be more efficient to have fewer employees in charge of fewer salespeople than many employees who can only manage a small amount of sales or a very large but unmanageable volume of business. For example, if five managers were to take care of one hundred salespeople, they could spend only 10 hours on production per day and still produce enough units for all of the customers in their region.\n        C. The problem with this solution is that each manager would be responsible for an equal number of salespeople (a thousand) or a lot fewer salespeople (five hundred), even if many of them were not really capable of managing much more than one person. If there are only five managers, the unit price could still be set at $150 per unit and produced 600 units by these workers in just ten hours, but if there are thirty-five managers, the unit cost would have to increase from $2.50 per hour to $7.00 or more (with a corresponding decrease in production) because each manager is now responsible for thousands of salespeople.\n        D. The solution can also be seen as a way to manage a large number of customers by having many managers, each responsible for managing only a small amount of business. This approach works well if the customer mix is evenly spread among all the salespeople and there are few different types of customers who would not respond to one product's price.\n        E. To make this solution work better (i.e., with a reasonable number of managers), it will be necessary for most companies to have many similar products that share some characteristics, such as being sold in stores or on the Internet. Then there are two possible scenarios: If customer volume is relatively stable and production costs do not change significantly from year to year, then each manager can set prices more closely than if a company has only one product with a high sales volume (because all units must be produced at the same price). For example, if three managers were to take care of 1,000 salespeople, their unit price could be increased by $50 in response to any small increase in production costs.\n        F. The best approach is for each manager to focus on a certain segment (e.g., 10 percent of the market share) with fewer products that can be handled well and produced efficiently using only a few employees. Then prices will have to rise when customer volume increases dramatically or the product's production cost rises significantly, because there would now be far more demand for these managers' services.\n        G. When a company is large enough to make this approach workable, some salespeople (e.g., 5 percent of the market share) can be managed at low prices without producing too many units and thereby adding unnecessary costs to production. The lower unit price makes it possible to produce more business in less time for every manager who takes care of these salespeople.\n        H. A company might try to manage all its products with a single pricing strategy, but this approach will only work well if the products have similar characteristics or are produced in different facilities under uniform management and supervision (e.g., using a central warehouse). For example, each employee could be assigned one product that is relatively easy for him/her to manage. Then prices would need to vary by region rather than by location of salespeople.\n        I. If the number of managers required exceeds the number of salespeople who can handle most business efficiently (e.g., 1,500), then it may make more sense to let each manager have an equal share of a very large territory (e.g., one state or country). For example, if all companies had territories with only a few employees and some customers in each region were served by many salespeople from different locations, managers would be required for the most efficient handling of business. This approach would not work well if there are only a small number of regions in which demand is relatively constant.\n        J. The best solution (for managing large volumes) would probably combine all the previous solutions: By using few customers per manager and many different products, each manager could be given some control over production without increasing customer service costs or having to hire more employees at higher prices (e.g., $2 per hour).\n        K. To ensure that the number of managers who handle business is reasonable compared to the company's overall volume, it may make sense for a smaller portion of salespeople to have all the responsibility and be paid on a flat rate (a fixed salary) rather than by units produced or hours worked.\n        L. In order for this solution to work well, it would probably also be necessary to have many companies with similar products in different regions that share some common characteristics such as being sold in stores or on the Internet. This means that each manager would need to focus on a certain segment (e.g., 10 percent of the market share) with fewer products that can be handled well and produced efficiently using only a few employees.\n        M. It may also make sense for some companies to have more than one pricing strategy, such as a large-volume price (with all customers paying higher prices), an average price that is acceptable for most customers but not everyone who buys from the company's headquarters, and a small-price policy for smaller salespeople whose volume is too low to justify having many managers. This approach would work well if there were only a few companies with similar products in different regions.\n        N. There are three possible approaches to managing large volumes of business: one manager (or few), many customers per manager, and many different types of customers that can be managed by each manager on a flat rate rather than by units produced or hours worked.\n",
